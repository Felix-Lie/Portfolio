        The Federal Communication Commission (FCC) is an independent government agency of the Unites Stated who regulates interstate and
        international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. They are also responsible for enforcing communication
        law. Individual's complaints on spam callers are filed with the Consumer Help Center since October 2014 until 2018. Everyday, the average spam callers
        are rising constantly. With individual's constant busy schedules, spam callers can be considered disturbing at some moment. 
        The aim of this project is to analyze the behavior of spam callers such as who, when, how and frequency of their calls.

        <strong>Fig 4.1</strong> shows the variables in this dataset. This dataset contains 15 variables and 1.5 million attributes.
        From all these variable, this project will take a closer look at the <strong> date complaint was made, location of complaint,
        date/time of the issue, form of issue and Caller ID. </strong> Some of the challenges present on this dataset are: (1) 45% of 
        the record's attribute contains null, leaving only 55% of the data that can be analyzed. (2) Some entries also shows "none" which 
        should be taken care off like the null attributes. (3) In addition, data such as day of the week should be relevel initially before 
        querying. <stong> This analysis will focus on: </stong>

      Following on from the first analysis, the phone complaints targeted 3 different recipients, which are wireless (like cellphone),
      wired, or Internet (VOIP). Among these three methods, the three different issues reported are unwanted calls, telemarketing and 
      robocalls. Based on the query and the histogram, we can conclude that unwanted calls are dominating the issue by more than 50%
      and done mostly through wireless device and these spam callers are mostly targetting mobile 
      devices.

      The second analysis of these spam callers are based on time. The three charts below shows the frequency based on a yearly, hourly,
      and day of the week manner respectively. As for the yearly chart, we can conclude that frequency increases on average. The hourly 
      chart tells us that spam callers peaked at 10am and 11am. At 12pm, frequency dropped as usually it is lunch time. Then it increase 
      again after lunch at 1 pm and gradually decrease towards the end of working hours. Lastly from the third chart shows that Wednesday 
      and Thursday to be the most busiest day fron unwanted calls. Based of this data, we can conclude that number of spam callers are 
      rising there are higher probabilities that you get called on Wednesday and Thursday in comparison to the rest of the week, between 
      10am to 1pm.

      <h4 class = "heading"> Conclusion </h4>
      <p>
        To sum up this analyses, the main objective of this project is to figure out when to ignore spam caller phones and know their 
        potential phone number. By understanding them, users can be more familiar with spam callers and can simply prepare counter measures to reject calls.
        This analyses can also be useful for telemarketers so they know when to call their recipients.
      </p>
      <p>
        To enhance the result of this analyses, some of the possible data that can be used together with this data are having the days of 
        the week in the dataset so that day of the week can be queried through MySQL. Having more data on people that actually benefit from 
        telemarketing and telemarketing data from other countries are good sources of identifying spams. In addition, knowing the effectiveness
        of robocall and telemarketing could really benefit telemarketers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, the analyses in this dataset tells us that spam callers mostly target their recipients on Wednesday and Thurday during 10am-1pm.
        Washington is one of the top 5 state with spam callers, where the city of Seattle are often targeted by cals and telemarketers from 
        Washington itself and California with Caller IDs 206, 425, 253, 360, 502 and 202.
