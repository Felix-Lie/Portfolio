      I am a graduate student with strong Data Analytics skill who transformed raw data into knowledgeable information. My deep passion 
      in data analytics had motivated me to pursue a Master's Degree in Information System (MSIS) at the University of Washington, Seattle.
      I will earn my Master's degree by June 2021 and currently looking for a full-time job on data related role, or consulting. During my studies
      as a graduate student, I learned a lot of knowledge on cybersecurity, how to handle data, decision making using solver, creating start schema,
      etc. Playing with data in MySQL, MS Excell, Tableau, Python and R are my comfort zones, followed by creating report and presentations. 
      All of my experience on handling data are interpreted in this portfolio under Projects. I will add another segment later on non-data related
      projects soon.

      This portfolio is intended to keep track of the data projects that I made so far during my education, in class and outside class projects.
      Back in winter break 2020, I utilized my holiday to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript just to get the feeling on how does the software developer's 
      work feels like. I know that learning HTML could be very beneficial for me in the future as this is excluded from the MSIS curriculum. Then, I thought
      about what can I make with HTML outside of class, and I remember that I could make a portfolio using HTML. Many people asked me
      questions like, "there are a lot of other simpler tool to make portfolio like wix.com, why chose a harder tool like HTML?" I simply told them
      that I wanted to hone my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills, this is why this portfolio is made using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
