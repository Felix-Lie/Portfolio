    <p> 
        When COVID-19 strikes in the early 2020, the world's economy stumbles. Few businesses got stronger such as tech companies, but the 
        rest struggled, while few came to an end. Airbnb is one of the business that still survives after the pandemic. They even managed to start
        trading their stocks on Nasdaq since December 2020. One of the key driver of Airbnb's success is that they act as a substitute service
        to hotels and accomodations at a cheaper price, connecting lender to renter in the market through their c2c business model as well as complemented
        by exceptional customer service.

    <p>
    <strong> Software used: Tableau </strong> <br>
    To view the dashboard directly, <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/WestSeattleAirbnb_16033177560840/WestSeattleAirbnbDashboard?:

    <h4 class = "heading"> Dataset </h4>
    <p>
      In this project, I used an Airbnb dataset which contains Airbnb listings prices and details. The dataset contains a lot of discrete and continuous
      variables such as First review, Last review, Host ID, Host Name, is Host Superhost, longitude, latitude, Listing URL, Name, neighbourhood
      details, price, summary, room type, zip code, accomodates how many people, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number of reviews,
      review score, rating, etc.
    </p>

    <h4 class = "heading"> Objective </h4>
    
    <p> 
      The aim of this project is to give insights to individuals in the West Seattle area who are trying to decide if they should rent
       a spare bedroom in their house on Airbnb or not. Some of the important information displayed on this dashboard are: <br>
      <ol>
        <li> Is there a lot of comparable competitors? </li>
        <li> What are the similar listings charging per night? </li>
        <li> How popular are similar listings and recent listings? </li>
      </ol> 
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong> Some of the specifications made on this Airbnb Dashboard are: </strong>
      <ol>
        <li> Compare listings that are similar to the specs of the objective (West Seattle area and spare bedroom). </li>
        <li> Contains one map, one crosstab, and one highlighted table. </li>
        <li> The use of tooltip (can be checked by opening the dashboard on the web directly, link on the Introduction section). </li>
        <li> Use Filter </li>
      </ol> 
    </p>
