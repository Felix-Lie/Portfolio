    <h4 class = "heading"> Introduction </h4>
    <p>
      Every year, many businesses closed due to different reasons, and many more individuals opened up new businesses. The fight for success
      to have a strong company becomes more difficult over time. No matter how success your company are, at some point you will need
      funding to scale up your start up business.  
    </p>  

    <p>
      <strong> Personal Role: </strong>
      As this is a gorup project, my role in this project is to analyze using data visualization when and is the best time to request funds and where.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Software used: R studio</b>
    </p>
    </div> 

    <div>
      <div class= "space"> </div>
      <h4 class = "heading"> Objective </h4>
      <p>
        The aim of this project is to analyze and predict the best available options for start up business owners to look for funding at the right 
        time and the right place. This project will help by telling which month, region and markets, and when they have the highest chance of 
        attracting investors. This project will consist of project goal, datadet description and preprocessing, data visualization, data modelling
        and summary.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <div class= "space"> </div>
      <h4 class = "heading"> The Dataset and Preprocessing</h4>
      <p>
        The dataset consist of 2 tables, one is the start up companies data file who receive the investment (companies datafile), and other data file is the 
        company that did the investment (investment datafile). The companies datafile consist of data such as status of the company, company's birth, funding status,
        the last time it was funded, how many times it was funded, funding rounds, market segment, location, when it was funded, etc.
        Similar to the companies data file, the investment data file contains information such as when and how much did the company do fundings, 
        their market segments, how long has the company stand, location, how many times do they perform funding, what market segments they often
        invest, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        To preprocess the data before analyzing it in RStudio, unwanted tables, duplicate rows and columns, signs like "+" and 145 outlier 
        records had been removed to avoid inaccuracy. Missing values with "na" or "0" had been properly replaced. The date colums had been 
        split into years and months. As this is real time data, outliers does exist and it is detected using boxplot.

            To start the analysis, we tried to figure out the market that is most popular. Therefore, we created a subset of all market and 
          order by descending frequency and took the top 10 rows. From there we created a pie chart to see the most popular market, which 
          was lead by software, biotechnology and mobile.

          Next analysis is based on which country earned the most funding, surprisingly neither US, Russia, India nor China make the top 10. 
          Instead small island nations of Bermuda and St.Martin is included. This might happen due to the corporate friendly tax system 
          of these countries. While other countries hold the highest amount of average finding, the US still have the vast majority funding 
          earned.

            Now we want to see how the average fundings differ by state, because we know investors has different preference for different business
            location. So I ran a histogram to see the average funding across the different state. Based on the analyses, we can see Connecticut 
            has the highest average funding, followed by Nebraska, Massachuset, California, Texas. However, what if a state has a high average 
            funding, but only one company receives it. We would want to make sure that biases does not happen that bumps up the average.

            Based on the countings we can see Connecticut and Nebraska has very small frequency, meaning there is a very small chance of 
            receiving funding. Meanwhile CA has too much funding which means there can be a lot of competition and higher chance of the 
            company closing. So we eliminated CA just to have a better picture of the rest of the states. Overall, MA
            and TX are the major states with higher fundings and high possibility of being funded. Therefore, it is up to entrepreneur 
            to decide between these states. If they want more competition and feel that their company is unique, go for MA or CA, 
            otherwise, go for TX for less competition.

            We analyzed the timeline of the yearly Average Funding just to predict what could be the estimate amount for next year.
            It looks like funding trends keeps on rising from 2011, therefore next year could be a good time to get fundings. We also 
            analyzed the average fundings by month just to know when is the best time to request for funding. And from this chart it 
            seems that January and November is the best time to request for funding from investors.

            Now, to understand how an individual can achieve the startup venture funding, we analyzed the funding round types. 
            We can infer from the bar charts that most of the companies obtained their funding by "Venture" and "Seed" funding, 
            but the "Post IPO Debt" raised maximum average funds followed by "Post IPO Equity" and "Grant" funding types. 
            We can also see that the highest number of investments are done in January, but the average funding amount spikes in 
            November and May. This is the result of a few outliers in the Funding Amount that we have in the dataset. There are a few 
            companies that managed to raise huge amount of funding in those months and as a result of this, we can see the spikes.

      <h4 class = "heading"> Clustering </h4>
      <div class="row">
        <p>
        Many startups may share some similar characteristics in attributes like marketing, region, and founded years. To detect what 
        common traits do most startups have, a clustering analysis must be conducted. The results in Fig 1.16 showed that
        "founded_year" was the only significant attribute in the model. To find out influence of other predictors, "founded_year" was turned 
        into a categorical variable by cutting it into 7 buckets, each packet with 5 year band. With all variables becoming categorical, 
        K-modes method was used, which is similar to Kmeans but is used for handling categorical objects. Kmode measure distance by 
        minimizing the sum of distance from the mode of that cluster not means. To pick the best number of cluster, an elbow chart was drawn 
        by computing the sum of within-cluster distance. From the elbow chart, we decided to pick 16 as our K-value which is at the "elbow."
        </p>

        <p>
          Fig 1.17 shows the K-mode clustering result of the 16 clusters ranked by cluster size. It seems that objects in cluster 1 and 2 are the
          most extensive with largest cluster sizes. We can infer that software startups founded between 2005-2009 and 2010-2014 in the 
          Bay Area were the most prevalent . Average distance to evaluate the compactness were checked too. In the last column, the 
          average distance of each cluster is around either 1 or 2 which means the data points in each cluster only have 1 or 2 predictor
          values different from cluster centroid. It signifies that objects in each cluster are close to each other.

      <h4 class = "heading"> Logistic Regression </h4>
      <p>
        Logistic regression was used to identify the probability of a company being open and how that changes for every additional 
        funding round, number of years after their last funding, and number of years after the company was founded for a software 
        company that was founded in the USA. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the companies dataset, all the numerical columns were identified and used for loops to create a column that identifies 
        US companies and a column that identifies companies that have software in their market name. Next, the levels of the status column 
        were checked which has 3 levels acquired, closed, and operating. Acquired and operating were combined to be open represented with 
        a 1 and all the closed companies with a 0. Then, data was partitioned into training data with 60% of the original dataset, and 
        validation data with 40%. After the first regression, insignificant predictors were removed such as funding total usd and ran 
        the regression again. A logistical regression and formula was achieved as you can see in the orange box of Fig 1.18.
      </p>
      <p>
        Running the car::vif() function to check for variables with a higher number than 2 were done to check for multicollinearity. 
        All the variables were below 2 meaning there is no correlation between the variables and we are ready to create a confusion 
        matrix. A cutoff value of 0.7 was used because it produced the highest accuracy of 92.5% and a Mcnemar's test p-value 
        of 2*e^-16. This means we were able to predict 92.5% of the validation data correctly with high sensitivity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The formula generated from the regression shows that a USA founded company in the software industry that has higher funding 
        rounds, greater number of years after the last funding year, and greater number of years after the founding year will reduce 
        their probability of staying open due to the high competition and consistent innovation in the USA software industry.

      <h4 class = "heading"> Classification Tree </h4>
      <p>
        If individual's were to raise more than $ 100 million funds, we would need to find out when and through which funding type can they 
        achieve this. So, aClassification Decision Tree was implememted to predict our set of rules. After studying the data modeling results, 
        we decided to focus on the startup companies founded in the USA. we worked on the classification with 2 predictors namely, "funding_quarter" 
        and "funding_type." We filtered the dataset from the investments table for startup companies founded in the USA and convert the funding 
        amount column to a binary datatype by applying the condition to check if the value is greater than or equal to 100 million. Lastly, 
        I extract the quarter from the "funded_quarter" attribute and partition the data into 60:40 ratio for the selected attributes.
        By building the full classification tree, a set of rules was achieved for predicting that individuals can get a funding of less than 
        $ 100 million, with 98.72% accuracy from the confusion matrix. A set of rules was also earned, like the ones listed below.
        To conclude, we can infer from the CART modeling that to raise $ 100 million or more for a startup venture fund, individuals have the highest 
        chance to achieve it in the 2nd quarter and through the Post IPO Equity funding round.

      <h4 class = "heading"> Key Results </h4>
      <p>
        From the various analysis, the conclusion shows that there is high competition and innovation in the US software industry. 
        The USA secures maximum funding compared to all the other international markets combined. Texas and Massachusetts raise high 
        average amounts of funding while maintaining a high frequency to do so. In the past 10 years, the SF Bay Area software market 
        is the biggest market which receives highest funding. From the data, the highest number of funding rounds take place in January where as, 
        the highest average amount of funding is raised in November & May. Also, most companies receive venture and seed funding while 
        the highest average funding is raised through Post IPO Debt and Equity.
